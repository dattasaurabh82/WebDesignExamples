<!--	TEXT FORMATTING
		Jeff Thompson | 2012-13 | www.jeffreythompson.org

		While almost all of our text formatting will be done with CSS, some basics
		are handled in HTML (which, of course, we can then tweak in CSS). These include:
			+ bold, italic, and strikethrough
			+ pre-formatted text
			+ line breaks
			+ spaces

		NOTE: in this source code, we use the special symbols '&lt;' and '&gt;' for the '<' and '>'
		symbols that would otherwise be interpreted as literal HTML tags. This is the same for many
		special characters in HTML including the spaces shown below.

		<!--	bold, italic, and strikethrough -->
		<p>
			We can format this text a lot of basic ways: <strong>bold</strong> (using the &lt;strong&gt; tag), 
			<em>italic (or emphasis,  using the &lt;em&gt; tag)</em>, and <strike>strikethrough</strike> (using the &lt;strike&gt; tag).
		</p>
		
		<!--	pre-formatted text -->
		<p>
			We can also created pre-formatted (also called monospaced) text using the &lt;pre&gt; tag:
			
			<pre>  This text will appear as a different font, with each character the same width. This is also great for ASCII art!  Note: no automatic line-breaks when the page is resized...</pre>

			Like &lt;pre&gt;, use &lt;code&gt; for <code>monospaced text</code> within a sentence.
		</p>
		
		<!-- 	line breaks -->
		<p>
			Notice the space between paragraphs? We can change that later, but
			using a line-break rather than a new paragraph is also useful, making
			text that looks like this:
			<br />		<!-- 	notice the tag is self-contained with a space and a '/' character;
							 	this was formerly required, now is optional -->
			This is text is the result of a line-break using the &lt;br /&gt; tag.
		</p>

		<!--	spaces -->
		<p>
			Sometimes you want more than one space between letters or words. One might think you could
			just type multiple spaces - nope! Instead, you must use a 'special character' in your HTML.
			Spaces are written as &lt;&amp;nbsp;&gt; in your HTML source code. Producing this result:
			<br /><br />
			This t&nbsp;e&nbsp;x&nbsp;t has&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extra s&nbsp;&nbsp;p&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;c&nbsp;&nbsp;e&nbsp;&nbsp;s inserted.
