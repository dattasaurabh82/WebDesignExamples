<!--	BASIC TEXT
		Jeff Thompson | 2012-13 | www.jeffreythompson.org

		Text blocks in HTML are generally defined using two structures:
			+ headline/header			used for section titles, etc
			+ paragraph						used for bodies of text
		
		Size, color, and other details for these elements will be later
		defined using CSS.
