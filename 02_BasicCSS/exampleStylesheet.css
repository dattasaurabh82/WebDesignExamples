BASIC CSS STYLESHEET
This is a basic stylesheet - it does basically everything except say
what goes on the page.  It handles color, size, and even position
of elements.

This is a multi-line comment - different from how it's done in HTML
because how could it ever be that easy!  The stuff at the very top tells
your browser that this is a CSS file.

A stylesheet is nothing without an HTML page to use it - see the 'exampleHTML.html'
to see this document in action.

AN EXAMPLE STYLE
A basic style has a name (see below) with the different selections contained
in curly brackets { }.  The styles to be applied are listed by name, followed
by a colon and their parameter(s), and ending in a semicolon.  For example, the
style below changes the <body> tag's background color to black:

	body {
		background-color: #000000;
	}

HTML ELEMENTS
You can define the way all instances of an HTML element look quite easily
using CSS - just list the name of the HTML tag followed by the styles you
want to apply to it!

CLASS
A class is a re-usable style that is applied to various parts across a
page (ie: it gets re-used), for example: section headers.

Classes are defined in CSS with a '.' before their name (ex: .secHeader)

ID
This is intended as a single-use element, for example: a main page title

IDs are defined with the '#' before their name (ex: #mainTitle)

/* BASIC HTML ELEMENTS*/
html, body {
	background-color: #C90;		/* change background color for entire document*/
}

h1 {																												/* changes all <h1> instances */
	font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;								/* define fonts to "degrade gracefully" is not present on user's computer */
	color: #555;																  						/* make text dark-ish gray */
	font-size: 24px;														  						/* change font size - essentially equivelant to pt measurement in Word, etc */
}

p {																													/* ... same as <h1> but for paragraph text */
	font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
	color: #000;
	font-size: 1em;			/* fonts can also be measured in Ems, see note below*/	
	text-align: left;
}

/*	PX vs EM:
		fonts measured in px are absolute and are based on the browser's resolution
		fonts measured in Ems are relative to the browser's level of zoom, making them more flexible and reliable
		
		fonts can also be measured in points (pt), picas (pc), inches (in), and centi- and millimeters (cm/mm), though
		these are not recommended for web work
*/


/* LINKS -- change what they look like, and how they react when hovered over */
a:link, a:visited {							/* basic link and one that has been clicked previously */
	color: #F00;
	text-decoration: none;				/* ie: no underline */
}
a:hover, a:active {							/* hover and active are when hovered (duh) or clicked on */
	color: #00F;
	text-decoration: underline;		/* when hovered, underline so we know */
}

/* Links should be clear but not distracting - a tough balance.  I suggest a color difference from
   the regular text but on underline except on rollover.  You can also use the border-bottom property
	 to give links a more flexible underline such as dotted or another color, which is nice too. */

/* DEFINE A CUSTOM WRAPPER USING CSS AND A <div> tag */
#wrapper {
	width: 900px;									/* width is measured in pixels */
	margin: 20px auto 20px auto;	/* margins are space AROUND something; listed as top, right, bottom, left** */
	background-color: white;			/* separate background color for the div; here we use one of the constant color values */
	padding: 50px;							  /* padding is space INSIDE something; this offsets the text so it doesn't hit the edge of the div */
}

/* **by setting our margin on L/R as auto, the <div> will float in the center of the screen until resized small
     than the width of the div */

/* A DIV INSIDE A DIV -- here we use a class (for deomonstration purposes, notice nothing
   breaks when we do this :)    */
	 
.nestedDiv {
	width: 600px;
	margin: 0px auto 0px auto;
  padding-top: 15px;											/* one direction can be specified separately, if necessary */
	background-color: #000;
  border: 3px #00FF00 dashed;							/* borders can applied to anything; specify thickness, color, and style (solid, dotted, etc) */
}
.nestedDiv p {														/* only for paragraphs inside the nestedDiv  */
	color: rgb(255,255,255) !important;			/* sometimes things don't work quite right - !important means override anything else in favor of this style */
	text-align: center;
}
