	<!-- LINKS -->
	<p>
		A basic link sends to you to another page; the code is 'inline', or within
		the line of text.  The anatomy of a link:
		
		<!-- note, we have to use special characters for the < and > so they
			 don't make a real link! see otherStuff.html for more info and examples -->
		    <pre>&lt;a href="anotherPage.html"&gt;the text that will be a link&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
		
		<strong>a</strong> means 'anchor', which is a link; <strong>href</strong> is where you put the address you
		want to link to.

		<br /><br />
		Links to <a href="01_FirstPageEver.html">internal pages</a>, in the same folder, can be listed as simply the filename.
		
		<br /><br />
		Links to <a href="http://www.amazon.com">external pages</a> (on another site) should always include the full URL including
		the 'http://' part.

		<br /><br />		
		To link into a <a href="exampleOfASubfolder/catGuitar.gif">subfolder</a> (perhaps of images), use the nameOfFolder/nameOfFile.extension
