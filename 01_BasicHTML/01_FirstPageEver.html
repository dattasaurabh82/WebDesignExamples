<!-- 	FIRST PAGE EVER
		Jeff Thompson | 2012-13 | www.jeffreythompson.org

		This is our most bare-bones web page! Note we are not using any CSS
		here that would make our pages more readable so you can see HTML as
		minimal as it gets.

		This information is in a comment, allowing you to make notes to yourself
		and others that might edit the site. For more info on comments, see the
		'02_Comments.html' page.

		Here we create the basic structure for all HTML pages:
		HEAD 	metadata, site title*, attached stylesheets, Javascript, etc
		BODY 	main page content

		* a site title isn't just descriptive - it is the text used when a
		visitor bookmarks your site, and is used by search engines (which often
		chop your title to 60 characters, so keep it short and sweet!)
		
		-->


<!-- 	the 'DOCTYPE declaration' tells the browser to interpret this as an HTML5 
		document (much more on that later) -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

	<!-- 	the 'head' section includes the page title and other metadata about the page
			don't foget to close it with </head>! -->
	<head>
		<title>"My Very Cool Website"</title>
	</head>

	<!-- 	the 'body' section is the page itself - all your content goes here -->
	<body>
		My website will go here very soon!
	</body>
