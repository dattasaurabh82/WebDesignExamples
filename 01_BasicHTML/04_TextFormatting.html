	<!-- TEXT FORMATTING -->
	<p>
		We can format this text a lot of basic ways: <strong>bold</strong> (&lt;strong&gt;), 
		<em>italic (or emphasis,  &lt;em&gt;)</em>, and <strike>strikethrough</strike> (&lt;strike&gt;).
	</p>
	
	<p>
		We can also created pre-formatted (also called monospaced) text using the &lt;pre&gt; tag:
		<pre>
    This text will appear as a different font, with each character the same width. This is also great for ASCII art!  Note: no automatic line-breaks when the page is resized...
		</pre>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Notice the space between paragraphs? We can change that later, but
		using a line-break rather than a new paragraph is also useful, making
		text that looks like this:
		<br />		<!-- notice the tag is self-contained with a space and a '/' character;
						 this was formerly required, now is optional -->
		This is text is the result of a line-break!
	</p>
	<p>
		You can also add a "line break opportunity" where the browser will break
		if it needs to using the 'wbr' tag.
	</p>
	<p>
		The tag for a line-break is &lt;br /&gt;... notice the / inside the tag; this means
		that it doesn't require a closing tag (images are similar).
